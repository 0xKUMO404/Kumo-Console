I am a new ethical hacker and I understand the pain of having to download a ton of tools, just to not really understand what I am doing. I want to developt a a tool that has everything a new ethical hacker needs to understand the basics of the most common tools. Some tools like nmap, metasploit, and burp suite.
If you want to help me developt this tool reach out to me and I will get back to you, hopefully soon.
